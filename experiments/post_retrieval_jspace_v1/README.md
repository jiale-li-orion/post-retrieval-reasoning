# Post-Retrieval Reasoning v1.0

This is the formal experiment line for the paper. It supersedes the old
Verbal-Annotation-only protocol as the top-level experimental contract while
reusing its annotation code as a component.

## Authority

Read these documents in order:

1. `../../FINAL_EXPERIMENTAL_PROTOCOL_v1.0.md`
2. `../../EXPERIMENT_DESIGN_AND_EXECUTION_PLAN_v1.0.md`
3. `PROTOCOL_ADDENDUM_v1.0.md`
4. `OPENCODE_SETUP.md`

If the addendum conflicts with either v1.0 document, the addendum governs the
items it explicitly changes. Everything else remains frozen by the final
protocol.

## Current Stage

- Phase 0: complete
- Gate A: in progress
- Gate B: not started
- Gate C: not started
- E2-E4: blocked until explicit human approval after Gate C

Gate A verified state as of 2026-07-11:

- Remote branch and GitHub origin are synchronized.
- Root `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` manage the single project environment.
- ATM Full/Hard hashes and all four fixed NIAH pools are validated.
- Qwen3-8B-ms, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B, Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, and
  Qwen3-VL-2B-Instruct pass BF16 CUDA load and adapter checks.
- Qwen3-VL-2B completed the two-question C0 vertical smoke with the official
  SGM formatter and evaluator. This smoke is infrastructure-only.
- Qwen3-VL-8B download/load validation remains open.
- The canonical `reranker3b-sft` download is in progress for Phase 2.
- The remote test suite passes 33 tests; warnings are limited to third-party
  SWIG deprecation messages.

## Machine Roles

- Remote WSL `/home/lab/lab` with RTX 4090: the only code-writing environment;
  open-weight behavior, canonical Verbal Annotation cache, J-lens fitting,
  readout, and later causal experiments.
- Local notebook: checks out a frozen commit and runs API answerers and the
  official ATM judge only. API keys stay in local environment variables.
- GitHub branch: `experiment/post-retrieval-jspace-v1`.

Large data, model weights, predictions, annotation caches, lens artifacts, and
trajectories are not committed. Git stores configs, manifests, hashes, summary
tables, and reports.

Behavior generation and judging are separate immutable stages. Generation
writes `predictions.jsonl`, token usage, latency, and an inference manifest; it
does not require judge credentials. `behavior/evaluate.py` later consumes that
frozen run and writes a separate evaluation directory and manifest. Only a run
containing `open_end` items requires `OPENAI_API_KEY`. J-lens fitting, readout,
and trajectory analysis never invoke the judge.

The project uses the root `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`; all commands run via
`uv run`. ATM-Bench remains a pinned source checkout and is exposed through
`PYTHONPATH` rather than installed with its optional vLLM dependency stack.

## Stop Rule

The first implementation cycle ends at Gate C. Do not start E2, E3, E4, or an
adaptive extension until the Gate C review bundle has been inspected and the
user explicitly approves continuation.
